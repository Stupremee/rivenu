//! Implementation of the registers for the RISC-V ISA.
//!
//! RISC-V has 32 integer registers which are [`XLEN`] bits wide.
//! There's also one additional register, `pc` the program counter.
//! There's no dedicated register that is used for the stack pointer,
//! or subroutine return address. The instruction encoding allows any
//! x register to be used for that purpose.
//!
//! However the standard calling conventions uses `x1` to store the return address of call,
//! with `x5` as an alternative link register, and `x2` as the stack pointer.
//!
//! The `x0` register is hardwired to zero and will ignore any writes.
//! `x1`-`x31` are general purpose registers
//!
//! [`XLEN`]: ../constant.XLEN.html
